In the medical field, many anomalies are diagnosed from digital images. Early detection
of these abnormalities is fundamental for a more efficient treatment and with fewer risks to
the patient, besides increasing the chances of a more favorable prognosis. To improve me-
dical diagnosis through imaging, digital image processing studies requirements to extract
technical information to enhance the parameters of a more accurate diagnosis. Decision
support systems, called Computer Aided Detection / Diagnosis - CAD / CADx, are com-
putational tools to aid medical diagnosis through imaging, giving the expert a second
opinion for a more accurate diagnosis. Thus, it is proposed to present an introduction
to Digital Image Processing applied to Medical Imaging with the OpenCV library using
the Python language. It is intended to allow an introductory view of the PDI through the
content provided, providing a greater understanding of the learning with practical appli-
cations, arousing greater interest and new ideas for applications in the most varied areas
of knowledge.
